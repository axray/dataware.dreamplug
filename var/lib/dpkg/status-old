Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users

Description: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
  samba - LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
  smbclient - LanManager-like simple client for Unix.
  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
  samba-doc - Samba documentation.
  samba-doc-pdf - Samba documentation in PDF format.
  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.2.x and above).
  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB/CIFS password
                   database
  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB/CIFS
                 servers
  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries
  libwbclient0 - Shared library for interfacing with the winbind service
  winbind - Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT
            servers
 .
 It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on
 your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB/CIFS servers you
 should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: GD Graphics Library version 2
 GD is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
 complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colours, cut and paste from
 other images, flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG file.
 This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG is
 one of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
 .
 This is the runtime package of the library, built with XPM (X pixmap)
 and fontconfig support.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It also makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

 /etc/ucf.conf 5565b8b26108c49ba575ba452cd69b3e
Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning shared library
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 This package contains libparted, the required shared library
 used by Parted.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
 removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the
 default package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of
 the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
 transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
 excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: DHCP client
 This is the client from version 3 of the Internet Software
 Consortium's implementation of DHCP. For more information visit
 http://www.isc.org.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package dhcp3-common.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .

Version: 2.5.35-6
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.7-1), m4
Pre-Depends: debconf | debconf-2.0
Recommends: gcc | c-compiler
Suggests: bison
Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 The behaviour of Flex has undergone a major change since version
 2.5.4a. Flex scanners are now reentrant, and it is now possible to
 have multiple scanners in the same program with differing sets of
 defaults, and the scanners play nicer with modern C and C++
 compilers. The Flip side is that Flex no longer conforms to the POSIX
 lex behaviour, and the scanners require conforming implementations
 when flex is used in ANSI C mode. The package flex-old provides the
 older behaviour.

 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.

Description: A perl module for simple terminal control
 Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
 control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for
 non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized handy
 functions for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the
 functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in "use
 Term::ReadKey" on any architecture and have a good likelyhood of it working.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Boost.Python Library development files
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 This package allows development of a Python interface for all current
 versions of Python in Debian.  Code using this library will need also
 one of the Python development packages.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL API (libraries)
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft library.

Description: automatically mount and unmount USB mass storage devices
 This package automatically mounts USB mass storage devices (typically
 USB pens) when they are plugged in, and unmounts them when they are
 removed. The mountpoints (/media/usb[0-7] by default), filesystem types
 to consider, and mount options are configurable. When multiple devices
 are plugged in, the first available mountpoint is automatically
 selected. If the device provides a model name, a symbolic link
 /var/run/usbmount/MODELNAME pointing to the mountpoint is automatically
 created.
 .
 The script that does the (un)mounting is called by the udev daemon.
 Therefore, USBmount requires a 2.6 (or newer) kernel.
 .
 USBmount is intended as a lightweight solution which is independent of
 a desktop environment. Users which would like an icon to appear when an
 USB device is plugged in should use the pmount and hal packages
 instead.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja provides a Django-like non-XML syntax and compiles templates
 into executable Python code. It's basically a combination of Django templates
 and Python code.
 .
 Philosophy: application logic is for the controller but don't try to make the
 life for the template designer too hard by giving him too few functionality.
 .
 Features:
  * Simple API.
  * Extremely lightweight.
  * The whole engine is completely sandboxed. A template designer won't be able
    to modify application data or execute dangerous code
  * You can use nearly every Python expression. Not supported are the binary
    operators and list comprehensions / generator expressions.
  * Uses the same concept for inheritance Django uses. It's very powerful
    and easy to understand.
  * Provides so called macros that allow you to put often used template
    snippets into callable blocks
  * Designer friendly. Jinja simplifies many things for a template designer.
    Loops can be used in a recursive way, filters are available to format
    values, loops know about their iteration etc.
  * Dynamic syntax. You don't like the Django block syntax? You can override
    the syntax elements on environment initialisation. It's no problem to use
    ASP/PHP/Ruby syntax, html comments for blocks etc.

Description: HTML::Template : A module for using HTML Templates with Perl
 This module attempts make using HTML templates simple and natural.  It
 extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>.  The file
 written with HTML and these new tags is called a template.  It is
 usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
 someone else!  Using this module you fill in the values for the
 variables, loops and branches declared in the template.  This allows
 you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate
 in the Perl script.
 .
 This module allows you to store its cache in shared memory using the
 IPC::SharedCache module, please install libipc-sharedcache-perl if you
 want to make use of this.

Description: regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected.  Features
 include:
 .
  * syslog support
  * Multiple ethernet interface support
  * Uses Debian's native ifup/ifdown programs
  * Small executable size and memory footprint
  * Option to beep when the cable is unplugged or plugged
  * Option to beep when the interface configuration succeeds or fails
  * Can be configured to ignore short unplugged or plugged periods
  * Configure WLAN devices (on detecting a successful association to an AP)
  * Supports SIOCETHTOOL, SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCDEVPRIVATE for getting link status
  * Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable detection

 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.10 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: GNU Interactive Tools, a file browser/viewer and process viewer/killer
 gnuit (GNU Interactive Tools) is a set of interactive text-mode tools,
 closely integrated with the shell.  It contains an extensible file
 system browser (similar to Norton Commander and XTree), an ASCII/hex
 file viewer, a process viewer/killer and some other related utilities
 and shell scripts.  It can be used to increase the speed and
 efficiency of most of the daily tasks such as copying and moving
 files and directories, invoking editors, compressing and
 uncompressing files, creating and expanding archives, compiling
 programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks nice, has colors (if the
 standard ANSI color sequences are supported) and is user-friendly.
 .
 One of the main advantages of gnuit is its flexibility.  It is not
 limited to a given set of commands.  The configuration file can be
 easily enhanced, allowing the user to add new commands or file
 operations, depending on its needs or preferences.

Description: secure shell client, an rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.

Description: movie player for Unix-like systems
 MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO,
 ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files,
 supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. It can
 also play VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies.
 .
 Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
 drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
 DirectFB, but also SDL (plus all its drivers) and some
 low level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon, Mach64
 and Permedia3). Most of them support software or hardware scaling,
 therefore allowing fullscreen display.  MPlayer is also able
 to use some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB
 and DXR3/Hollywood+.
 .
 Not all of the upstream code is distributed in the source tarball.

Description: Debian Font Manager -- automatic font configuration framework
 Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework
 for automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration
 of fonts usually requires manual intervention can automate the
 process through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration
 script. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and
 removed, so that the script may update the application configuration.
 .
 Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them
 configured automatically for applications.

 .
  exim4-daemon-light
  exim4-daemon-heavy
 .
 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also
 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Description: regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: A DNS protocol implementation with client and server
 Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client
 resolver library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box"
 nameserver which can read most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a
 simple Python-based configuration format. Twisted Names can act as an
 authoritative server, perform zone transfers from a master to act as
 a secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or any combination of
 these. Twisted Names' client resolver library provides functions to
 query for all commonly used record types as well as a replacement for
 the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib
 socket module.
