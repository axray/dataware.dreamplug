   <h3>Lamp Stack Application Host</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>The acronym LAMP refers to a solution stack of software consisting of web server(apache), MySQL(database management system) and a scripting language(Perl,Python etc.).</li>
       <li>Wireless SheevaPlug can host an application which requires LAMP stack. The required packages and dependencies are included into the rootfs.</li>
       <li>As an example, Wireless SheevaPlug hosts a couple of applications - an unconfigured plogger & flow player.</li>
       <li><b>Plogger : </b>You can access the existing plogger page at - <br> <a href="/plogger/" target="__new">this link</a> If you haven't yet configured your plogger installation, you can do so from  <a href="/plogger/_install.php" target="__new">here</a></li>
       <li>The configuration details are - <br> <b>host:localhost</b> <br> <b>username:root</b> <br> <b>password:nosoup4u</b> <br> <b>databasename:plogger</b> </li>
       <li><b>Flow Player : </b>You can access the FlowPlayer page at - <br> <a href="/flowplayer/example/" target="__new">this link</a></li>
       <li>There you can see an example video - which is originally at the flowplayer site - being streamed in and played in your browser window. </li>
        <li>Similarly, some other application requiring LAMP stack, such as Gallery (<a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" target="__new">http://gallery.menalto.com</a>) may be deployed in a similar fashion.</li>
     </ul>
