   <h3>Wireless Router</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>The Wireless SheevaPlug can function as a wireless router device.</li>
       <li>When powered on, it comes up with a pre-configured SSID <b>'SheevaPlug-uAP-0001'</b></li>
       <li>You will be able to see this SSID in the list of 'Available Wireless Networks' on your wireless client.</li>
       <li>Clicking on the above SSID will associate your wireless client with the SheevaPlug.</li>
       <li>Once associated, the wireless client will get an IP address from the range 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200 </li>
       <li>At this point, you will be able to view this page by entering 'http://192.168.1.1/' into the the address bar of the browser running on your wireless client. You may also be able to ssh into the SheevaPlug by specifying the IP address 192.168.1.1 </li>
       <li>If you wish to change the IP address range, please follow the instructions <a href="/cgi-bin/dhcp_range_settings.cgi" target="__new">here</a></li>
       <li>You will also be able to access other devices connected to the SheevaPlug over wireless, as well as the USB.</li>
       <li>In addition, if the ethernet port of the SheevaPlug is connected to the internet, you will be able to browse the same.</li>
       <li>Please note that the wireless network is Unsecured (meaning no password is required for association).</li>
     </ul>
