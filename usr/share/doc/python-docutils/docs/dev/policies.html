<p>The Docutils project group is a meritocracy based on code contribution
and lots of discussion <a class="footnote-reference" href="#bcs" id="id1">[1]</a>.  A few quotes sum up the policies of
the Docutils project.  The IETF's classic credo (by MIT professor Dave
Clark) is an ideal we can aspire to:</p>
<blockquote>
We reject: kings, presidents, and voting.  We believe in: rough
consensus and running code.</blockquote>
<p>As architect, chief cook and bottle-washer, David Goodger currently
functions as BDFN (Benevolent Dictator For Now).  (But he would
happily abdicate the throne given a suitable candidate.  Any takers?)</p>
<p>Eric S. Raymond, anthropologist of the hacker subculture, writes in
his essay <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/">The Magic Cauldron</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The number of contributors [to] projects is strongly and inversely
correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a user go
through to contribute.</blockquote>
<p>We will endeavour to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible.
The policies below should not be thought of as barriers, but merely as
a codification of experience to date.  These are &quot;best practices&quot;;
guidelines, not absolutes.  Exceptions are expected, tolerated, and
used as a source of improvement.  Feedback and criticism is welcome.</p>
<p>As for control issues, Emmett Plant (CEO of the Xiph.org Foundation,
originators of Ogg Vorbis) put it well when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
Open source dictates that you lose a certain amount of control
over your codebase, and that's okay with us.</blockquote>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Python Coding Conventions</a></h1>
<p>Contributed code will not be refused merely because it does not
strictly adhere to these conditions; as long as it's internally
consistent, clean, and correct, it probably will be accepted.  But
don't be surprised if the &quot;offending&quot; code gets fiddled over time to
conform to these conventions.</p>
<p>The Docutils project shall follow the generic coding conventions as
specified in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html">Style Guide for Python Code</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html">Docstring
Conventions</a> PEPs, summarized, clarified, and extended as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>4 spaces per indentation level.  No hard tabs.</li>
<li>Use only 7-bit ASCII, no 8-bit strings.  See <a class="reference external" href="../howto/i18n.html#python-code">Docutils
Internationalization</a>.</li>
<li>No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">x:</span> <span class="pre">return</span></tt>: use two
lines &amp; indentation), except for degenerate class or method
definitions (i.e., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span> <span class="pre">X:</span> <span class="pre">pass</span></tt> is OK.).</li>
<li>Lines should be no more than 78 characters long.</li>
<li>Use &quot;StudlyCaps&quot; for class names (except for element classes in
docutils.nodes).</li>
<li>Use &quot;lowercase&quot; or &quot;lowercase_with_underscores&quot; for function,
method, and variable names.  For short names, maximum two words,
joined lowercase may be used (e.g. &quot;tagname&quot;).  For long names with
three or more words, or where it's hard to parse the split between
two words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g.,
&quot;note_explicit_target&quot;, &quot;explicit_target&quot;).  If in doubt, use
underscores.</li>
<li>Avoid lambda expressions, which are inherently difficult to
understand.  Named functions are preferable and superior: they're
faster (no run-time compilation), and well-chosen names serve to
document and aid understanding.</li>
<li>Avoid functional constructs (filter, map, etc.).  Use list
comprehensions instead.</li>
<li>Avoid <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">__future__</span> <span class="pre">import</span></tt> constructs.  They are inappropriate
for production code.</li>
<li>Use 'single quotes' for string literals, and &quot;&quot;&quot;triple double
quotes&quot;&quot;&quot; for docstrings.</li>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Copyrights and Licensing</a></h1>
<p>The majority of the Docutils project code and documentation has been
placed in the public domain.  Unless clearly and explicitly indicated
otherwise, any patches (modifications to existing files) submitted to
the project for inclusion (via Subversion, SourceForge trackers,
mailing lists, or private email) are assumed to be in the public
domain as well.</p>
<p>Any new files contributed to the project should clearly state their
intentions regarding copyright, in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Public domain (preferred): include the statement &quot;This
module/document has been placed in the public domain.&quot;</li>
<li>Copyright &amp; open source license: include a copyright notice, along
with either an embedded license statement, a reference to an
accompanying license file, or a license URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the goals of the Docutils project, once complete, is to be
incorporated into the Python standard library.  At that time copyright
of the Docutils code will be assumed by or transferred to the Python
Software Foundation (PSF), and will be released under Python's
license.  If the copyright/license option is chosen for new files, the
license should be compatible with Python's current license, and the
author(s) of the files should be willing to assign copyright to the
PSF.  The PSF accepts the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php">Academic Free License v. 2.1</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php">Apache

<div class="section" id="subversion-repository">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Subversion Repository</a></h1>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="repository.html">repository documentation</a> for details on how to
access Docutils' Subversion repository.  Anyone can access the
repository anonymously.  Only project developers can make changes.
(If you would like to become a project developer, just ask!)  Also see
<a class="reference internal" href="#setting-up-for-docutils-development">Setting Up For Docutils Development</a> below for some useful info.</p>
<p>Unless you really <em>really</em> know what you're doing, please do <em>not</em> use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">import</span></tt>.  It's quite easy to mess up the repository with an
import.</p>
<div class="section" id="branches">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Branches</a></h2>
<p>(These branch policies go into effect with Docutils 0.4.)</p>
<p>The &quot;docutils&quot; directory of the <strong>trunk</strong> (a.k.a. the <strong>Docutils
core</strong>) is used for active -- but stable, fully tested, and reviewed
-- development.</p>
<p>There will be at least one active <strong>maintenance branch</strong> at a time,
based on at least the latest feature release.  For example, when
Docutils 0.5 is released, its maintenance branch will take over, and
the 0.4.x maintenance branch may be retired.  Maintenance branches
will receive bug fixes only; no new features will be allowed here.</p>
<p>Obvious and uncontroversial bug fixes <em>with tests</em> can be checked in
directly to the core and to the maintenance branches.  Don't forget to
add test cases!  Many (but not all) bug fixes will be applicable both
to the core and to the maintenance branches; these should be applied
to both.  No patches or dedicated branches are required for bug fixes,
but they may be used.  It is up to the discretion of project
developers to decide which mechanism to use for each case.</p>
<p>Feature additions and API changes will be done in <strong>feature
branches</strong>.  Feature branches will not be managed in any way.
Frequent small checkins are encouraged here.  Feature branches must be
discussed on the docutils-develop mailing list and reviewed before
being merged into the core.</p>
<div class="section" id="review-criteria">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Review Criteria</a></h3>
<p>Before a new feature, an API change, or a complex, disruptive, or
controversial bug fix can be checked in to the core or into a
maintenance branch, it must undergo review.  These are the criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The branch must be complete, and include full documentation and
tests.</li>
<li>There should ideally be one branch merge commit per feature or
change.  In other words, each branch merge should represent a
coherent change set.</li>
<li>The code must be stable and uncontroversial.  Moving targets and
features under debate are not ready to be merged.</li>
<li>The code must work.  The test suite must complete with no failures.
See <a class="reference external" href="testing.html">Docutils Testing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The review process will ensure that at least one other set of eyeballs
&amp; brains sees the code before it enters the core.  In addition to the
above, the general <a class="reference internal" href="#check-ins">Check-ins</a> policy (below) also applies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="check-ins">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Check-ins</a></h2>
<p>Changes or additions to the Docutils core and maintenance branches
carry a commitment to the Docutils user community.  Developers must be
prepared to fix and maintain any code they have committed.</p>
<p>The Docutils core (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trunk/docutils</span></tt> directory) and maintenance
branches should always be kept in a stable state (usable and as
problem-free as possible).  All changes to the Docutils core or
maintenance branches must be in <a class="reference internal" href="#good-shape">good shape</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#usable">usable</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#documented">documented</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#tested">tested</a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#reasonably-complete">reasonably complete</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="target" id="good-shape">Good shape</span> means that the code is clean, readable, and free of
junk code (unused legacy code; by analogy to &quot;junk DNA&quot;).</li>
<li><span class="target" id="usable">Usable</span> means that the code does what it claims to do.  An &quot;XYZ
Writer&quot; should produce reasonable XYZ output.</li>
<li><span class="target" id="documented">Documented</span>: The more complete the documentation the better.
Modules &amp; files must be at least minimally documented internally.
<a class="reference external" href="../user/tools.html">Docutils Front-End Tools</a> should have a new section for any
front-end tool that is added.  <a class="reference external" href="../user/config.html">Docutils Configuration Files</a>
should be modified with any settings/options defined.  For any
non-trivial change, the <a class="reference external" href="../../HISTORY.txt">HISTORY.txt</a> file should be updated.</li>
<li><span class="target" id="tested">Tested</span> means that unit and/or functional tests, that catch all
bugs fixed and/or cover all new functionality, have been added to
the test suite.  These tests must be checked by running the test
suite under all supported Python versions, and the entire test suite
must pass.  See <a class="reference external" href="testing.html">Docutils Testing</a>.</li>
<li><span class="target" id="reasonably-complete">Reasonably complete</span> means that the code must handle all input.
Here &quot;handle&quot; means that no input can cause the code to fail (cause
an exception, or silently and incorrectly produce nothing).
&quot;Reasonably complete&quot; does not mean &quot;finished&quot; (no work left to be
done).  For example, a writer must handle every standard element
from the Docutils document model; for unimplemented elements, it
must <em>at the very least</em> warn that &quot;Output for element X is not yet
implemented in writer Y&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really want to check code directly into the Docutils core,
you can, but you must ensure that it fulfills the above criteria
first.  People will start to use it and they will expect it to work!
If there are any issues with your code, or if you only have time for
gradual development, you should put it on a branch or in the sandbox
first.  It's easy to move code over to the Docutils core once it's
complete.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility and obligation of all developers to keep the
Docutils core and maintenance branches stable.  If a commit is made to
the core or maintenance branch which breaks any test, the solution is
simply to revert the change.  This is not vindictive; it's practical.
We revert first, and discuss later.</p>
<p>Docutils will pursue an open and trusting policy for as long as
possible, and deal with any aberrations if (and hopefully not when)
they happen.  We'd rather see a torrent of loose contributions than
just a trickle of perfect-as-they-stand changes.  The occasional
mistake is easy to fix.  That's what Subversion is for!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-numbering">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Version Numbering</a></h1>
<p>Docutils version numbering uses a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">major.minor.micro</span></tt> scheme (x.y.z;
for example, 0.4.1).</p>
<p><strong>Major releases</strong> (x.0, e.g. 1.0) will be rare, and will represent
major changes in API, functionality, or commitment.  For example, as
long as the major version of Docutils is 0, it is to be considered
<em>experimental code</em>.  When Docutils reaches version 1.0, the major
APIs will be considered frozen and backward compatibility will become
of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Releases that change the minor number (x.y, e.g. 0.5) will be
<strong>feature releases</strong>; new features from the <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/trunk/docutils/">Docutils core</a> will be
included.</p>
<p>Releases that change the micro number (x.y.z, e.g. 0.4.1) will be
<strong>bug-fix releases</strong>.  No new features will be introduced in these
releases; only bug fixes off of <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/branches/">maintenance branches</a> will be
included.</p>
<p>This policy was adopted in October 2005, and will take effect with
Docutils version 0.4.  Prior to version 0.4, Docutils didn't have an
official version numbering policy, and micro releases contained both
bug fixes and new features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snapshots">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Snapshots</a></h1>
<p>Snapshot tarballs will be generated regularly from</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the Docutils core, representing the current cutting-edge state of
development;</li>
<li>each active maintenance branch, for bug fixes;</li>
<li>each development branch, representing the unstable
seat-of-your-pants bleeding edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update</span></tt> shell script, run as an
hourly cron job on the BerliOS server, is responsible for
automatically generating the snapshots and updating the web site.  See
the <a class="reference external" href="website.html">web site docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-for-docutils-development">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Setting Up For Docutils Development</a></h1>
<p>When making changes to the code, testing is a must.  The code should
be run to verify that it produces the expected results, and the entire
test suite should be run too.  The modified Docutils code has to be
accessible to Python for the tests to have any meaning.  There are two
ways to keep the Docutils code accessible during development:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Update your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH</span></tt> environment variable so that Python
picks up your local working copy of the code.  This is the
recommended method.</p>
<p>We'll assume that the Docutils trunk is checked out under your
~/projects/ directory as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svn co svn+ssh://&lt;user&gt;&#64;svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils/trunk \
    docutils
</pre>
<p>For the bash shell, add this to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.profile</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PYTHONPATH=$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils/extras
export PYTHONPATH
</pre>
<p>The first line points to the directory containing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docutils</span></tt>
package.  The second line adds the directory containing the
third-party modules Docutils depends on.  The third line exports
this environment variable.  You may also wish to add the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tools</span></tt>
directory to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PATH</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils/tools
export PATH
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Before you run anything, every time you make a change, reinstall
Docutils:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py install
</pre>
<div class="caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution!</p>
<p>This method is <strong>not</strong> recommended for day-to-day development;
it's too easy to forget.  Confusion inevitably ensues.</p>
<p class="last">If you install Docutils this way, Python will always pick up the
last-installed copy of the code.  If you ever forget to
reinstall the &quot;docutils&quot; package, Python won't see your latest
changes.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A useful addition to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docutils</span></tt> top-level directory in branches
and alternate copies of the code is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set-PATHS</span></tt> file
containing the following lines:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# source this file
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/extras
export PATH=$PWD/tools:$PATH
</pre>
<p>Open a shell for this branch, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docutils</span></tt> top-level
directory, and &quot;source&quot; this file.  For example, using the bash
shell:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd some-branch/docutils
$ . set-PATHS
</pre>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">The Sandbox</a></h1>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/trunk/sandbox/">sandbox directory</a> is a place to play around, to try out and
share ideas.  It's a part of the Subversion repository but it isn't
distributed as part of Docutils releases.  Feel free to check in code
to the sandbox; that way people can try it out but you won't have to
worry about it working 100% error-free, as is the goal of the Docutils
core.  A project-specific subdirectory should be created for each new
project.  Any developer who wants to play in the sandbox may do so,
but project directories are recommended over personal directories,
which discourage collaboration.  It's OK to make a mess in the
sandbox!  But please, play nice.</p>
<p>Please update the <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/README.html">sandbox README</a> file with links and a brief
description of your work.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the work necessary for others to install and try
out new, experimental components, the following sandbox directory
structure is recommended:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sandbox/
    project_name/ # For a collaborative project.
        README.txt  # Describe the requirements, purpose/goals, usage,
                    # and list the maintainers.
        docs/
            ...
        component.py    # The component is a single module.
                        # *OR* (but *not* both)
        component/      # The component is a package.
            __init__.py  # Contains the Reader/Writer class.
            other1.py    # Other modules and data files used
            data.txt     # by this component.
            ...
        test/       # Test suite.
            ...
        tools/      # For front ends etc.
            ...
        setup.py    # Use Distutils to install the component
                    # code and tools/ files into the right
                    # places in Docutils.
    userid/       # For *temporary* personal space.
</pre>
<p>Some sandbox projects are destined to move to the Docutils core once
completed.  Others, such as add-ons to Docutils or applications of
Docutils, may graduate to become <a class="reference internal" href="#parallel-projects">parallel projects</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-projects">
<span id="parallel-project"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Parallel Projects</a></h1>
<p>Parallel projects contain useful code that is not central to the
functioning of Docutils.  Examples are specialized add-ons or
plug-ins, and applications of Docutils.  They use Docutils, but
Docutils does not require their presence to function.</p>
<p>An official parallel project will have its own directory beside (or
parallel to) the main <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docutils</span></tt> directory in the Subversion
repository.  It can have its own web page in the
docutils.sourceforge.net domain, its own file releases and
downloadable snapshots, and even a mailing list if that proves useful.
However, an official parallel project has implications: it is expected
to be maintained and continue to work with changes to the core
Docutils.</p>
<p>A parallel project requires a project leader, who must commit to
coordinate and maintain the implementation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Answer questions from users and developers.</li>
<li>Review suggestions, bug reports, and patches.</li>
<li>Monitor changes and ensure the quality of the code and
documentation.</li>
<li>Coordinate with Docutils to ensure interoperability.</li>
<li>Put together official project releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, related projects may be created independently of Docutils.
The advantage of a parallel project is that the SourceForge
environment and the developer and user communities are already
established.  Core Docutils developers are available for consultation
and may contribute to the parallel project.  It's easier to keep the
projects in sync when there are changes made to the core Docutils
code.</p>
