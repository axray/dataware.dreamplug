This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Digest::SHA1
(renamed to be libdigest-sha1-perl).

The Digest::SHA1 module allows you to use the NIST SHA-1 message
digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The algorithm takes as
input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 160-bit
"fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

SHA1 is described at <http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm>

This package was put together by Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org>.
Matthias Urlichs <smurf@debian.org> took over maintenance upon the
release of version 2.10-1 .  However, due to his heavy workload, he
opted to put this package up for adoption.
Zak B. Elep <zakame@spunge.org> now maintains this package.

The original sources should always be available from the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.
