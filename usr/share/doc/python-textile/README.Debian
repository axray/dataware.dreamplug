This package is auto-sufficient, but you can install other packages
alongside to get some nifty effects.

For example, the "htmlizer" from python-twisted allows PyTextile to
automatically colorize documents sporting Python syntax.

It can use mxTidy or uTidyLib to validate the generated XHTML output,
but at the time of writing this, none of them are packaged.
