		Multiple Python Runtime Support
		-------------------------------

The Debian Boost.Python packages support python versions: 2.4, 2.5.

As is typical of Boost (see /usr/share/doc/libboost-dev/README.Debian)
the library names encode the boost version, gcc version, thread
support, and the like.  The upstream names do NOT encode the python
version.  However, for Debian to support multiple Python runtimes, we
do need to encode the python version.  

	Choosing the default Python
	---------------------------

To keep backwards compatibility, the standard upstream link library
names are generated as symlinks to the default python version.

If you want to use the non-standard Debian-specific simplified
library names, you may simply link with -lboost_python.  This
will always be the default python version.

These default symlinks are automatically updated when the Python
runtime version changes.


	Choosing a specific Python Version
	----------------------------------

The library names are suffixed by "-py24" and "-py25", allowing you to
select the specific Python version desired.  This holds true
for both the upstream names and the simplified Debian names.

So if you want to use the simplified names, link against
-lboost_python-py24 for Python 2.4.
